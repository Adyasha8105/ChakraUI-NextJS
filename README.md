## About the Project

This pandemic helped me bring out the best in me. I worked on my designing skills, build my skills basically on the MERN stack and learnt as much as I can about new technologies.
So for that I made a landing page (small project) that could help you to get a brief idea about the basic functionalities using *Chakra UI* interface library on *Next JS* ;)

If you like it, show some love by giving it a ‚≠ê

### Built With

This is made using amazing *NextJS*, a React framework that is widely known for it's performance and SEO optimisation and *Chakra UI* , simple and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

Here are a few more things, included:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [ChakraUI library](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) for amazing SVG Images
